## PORTFOLIO
# Iot Interaction + Neural Reader Device
 
This is a program developed in Unity, with the aim of helping to improve the daily life of people who suffer from some kind of dependency. In this case, a neural wave reader (EEG), called NextMind, was used. This device will be able to read our neuronal waves and therefore, know which part of the screen we are looking at. So, I developed a program, that through augmented reality (Vuforia) read a target (in our case we used a QR as a target), then when reading the target, it will show us several actions that we can select using the NextMind. When selecting an action, our code will make a GET request to a server where the IoT devices are located, so that it performs an action. Attached is the video interacting with a lamp using these technologies.

# Communicator based on Hand Tracking (Machine Learnign)
 
In this case, it is a communicator that uses a tts algorithm for people with speech difficulties. The operation of this is very simple, we will use a program based on a carousel of pictographs that are illuminated every x seconds. When the user decides which pictograph he wants the program to say, he only has to show his hand to the camera. The program has a Machine Learning algorithm that when detecting the hand, generates a trigger and says the phrase we want.
